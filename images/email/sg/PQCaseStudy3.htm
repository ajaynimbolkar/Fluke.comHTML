        This case history comes from an electrical contractor. Several of this
        contractor's clients operate large commercial buildings. One of these
        clients asked for help with a large transformer that had suddenly
        started vibrating and making a loud buzzing sound. The client was
        concerned that the transformer was ready to fail and he would be faced
        with an expensive replacement. The contractor dispatched an engineer at
        once.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
 When the engineer arrived at the plant, he took out his notebook
        and his Fluke 43B. He then made the following notes and one line
        diagram:<br>
          <br>

        <br>
          <b>
        Measurement data<br>
          </b>
        The engineer recorded the following data using the Fluke 43B :<br>
          <b>
        Secondary voltage total harmonic distortion</b>: 2.7%<br>
          <b>
        Secondary voltage balance</b>: within 1%<br>
          <b>
        Secondary current</b>: 57 A rms<br>
          <b>
        Secondary current spectrum</b>:<br>
        Fundamental&nbsp; 55A<br>
        2nd harmonic 1.6A<br>
        3rd harmonic 2.5A<br>
        4th harmonic 0.7A<br>
        5th harmonic 2.4A<br>
        6th harmonic 0.4A<br>
        7th harmonic 4.0A<br>
          <br>

          <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>Theory
          and analysis<br>
          </b>The voltage measurements do not show anything abnormal. The
          voltage total harmonic distortion is well within the maximum allowable
          value of 5%. Voltage balance between phases also looks good. The
          secondary current of 57A indicates the client was correct in stating
          the transformer was lightly loaded. No overheating was noted.<br>
          <br>
          When a transformer is in trouble, this contractor's engineers always
          use a Fluke 43B to measure the harmonic spectrum of the secondary
          current. The spectrum acts like a fingerprint, indicating the types of
          loads present. In this case, the presence of the 3rd harmonic shows
          that part of the load consists of single-phase devices (eg.
          fluorescent lighting ballasts) connected phase to neutral. In the
          data, the amount of the 3rd harmonic is relatively low and appears to
          be normal.<br>
          <br>
          The 5th and 7th harmonics indicate that part of the load is a large
          3-phase device with semiconductor rectifiers in the input circuit. The
          most common example would be an adjustable speed motor drive operating
          a fan or pump. When a 3-phase motor drive is operating normally, the
          input current waveforms are symmetrical about zero. That is, the
          positive going portion of the waveform looks like the mirror image of
          the negative portion. When all semiconductors are operating normally,
          the input currents have no dc offset and only odd harmonics are
          present.<br>
          <br>
          The engineer noted that the spectrum had even harmonics (2nd, 4th, and
          6th). These abnormal harmonics indicate the presence of dc current in
          the transformer secondary winding. Compare the example spectrums in
          Fig.2 and Fig.3. Unfortunately, dc current tends to saturate the
          transformer core at the peak of one half of the ac waveform. When the
          core goes in and out of saturation, it will vibrate and make a loud
          buzzing noise.<br>
          <br>
          The engineer suspected that the plant load contained a large motor
          drive and that one of the input semiconductors had failed open. If one
          semiconductor is open, the circuit on that phase becomes a half-wave
          rectifier - it produces dc current. The trick here is that the motor
          drive will continue to operate at low speed because the other two
          phases are operating normally.<br>
