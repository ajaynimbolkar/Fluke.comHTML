          This case history is a classic example of the importance of a
          systematic approach to solve a problem. It involves a contractor who
          works with several high-technology manufacturing plants.<br>
          <br>
          The case began with an on-site visit to a building manager who was
          frustrated with his electrical system. According to the manager,
          nothing electrical in his building seemed to work properly and no one
          had been able to determine why or offer a solution. The manager went
          on to say that three of his electricians had quit and that he was now
          in real trouble.<br>
          <br>
          The contractor asked many questions - trying to get a more detailed
          picture of the problem. This effort proved fruitless, so the
          contractor asked to be taken to that part of the building where the
          problems were the worst. He was following the axiom, &quot;When in
          doubt, start at the victim load.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          In a far corner, a large medical machine was going through a critical
          test procedure. The machine was equipped with a large display screen,
          a keyboard and a control panel with several cables and hoses leading
          to other pieces of equipment. The operator display screen showed the
          test procedure was in progress.<br>
          <br>
          Next to the machine was a workbench set up for the circuit board
          repair. The workbench had a soldering iron, a lighted magnifying lens
          and a fan. The workbench power strip plugged into the same receptacle
          as the large medical machine. As the contractor watched, the person at
          the workbench reached over and turned on the fan. At that moment, the
          operator display screen momentarily went blank and then came back on
          with the words &quot;Program Reset&quot; displayed in large
          letters....<br>
