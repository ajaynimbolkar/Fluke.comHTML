          Motor failures can be mysterious. Often, the mechanical loads on the
          motors have not changed and other loads connected to the same service
          appear to work normally - yet, the motors just fail. The cause of
          these mysterious failures is frequently a power quality deficiency.
          Consequently, the motor rewind industry has become involved in power
          quality troubleshooting. In this case history, the supervisor of a
          motor rewind shop investigated a rash of failures at a small machine
          shop.<br>
          <br>
          His investigation process began with a series of questions to search
          for any pattern that might be common to the failed units, and to see
          what had changed since the time before the problem surfaced.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Often, the pattern is one of age. In this case, there was no age
          pattern - some of the failed motors were nearly new. Others were much
          older, and some of these had been rewound at the motor shop. But,
          there was a pattern: all the failed units had been carrying full
          mechanical loads and the windings showed evidence of overheating.<br>
          <br>
          The machine shop itself hadn't undergone any changes. But an insurance
          company had moved into a new building next door. And they had done so
          at about the time when the motor failures began. The same utility
          transformer supplied both buildings (see Fig.1).<br>
