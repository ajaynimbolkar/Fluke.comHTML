Changes in ambient temperature should be compensated for automatically. • When testing 3-wire RTD circuits make sure to connect all three wires from the sourcing RTD simulator to the device being tested. Shorting out the compensation wire at the transmitter defeats the lead compensation circuit and introduces measurement errors.

Depending on the temperature range a low, high, and midpoint temperature may be chosen. If the infrared thermometer has an emissivity setting, it should be set to match the calibrated emissivity of the source. Position the infrared thermometer at the manufacturer’s recommended calibration distance. Center the infrared thermometer on the calibrator surface. Do this by adjusting the aim slightly side to side and up and down to maximize the signal. The measurement time should be ten times longer than the infrared thermometer’s response time. This is typically five seconds for Fluke infrared thermometers.

They should be tested during commissioning and again when removed from a process to verify that tolerances were met. Additionally, thermocouples may be tested at regular calibration intervals and when suspected of failing to meet their performance specifications. Often thermocouples need to be calibrated prior to use for mapping a temperature controlled enclosure, or they have to be calibrated for use as a temperature standard. Due to the unique characteristics of thermocouples, they are best calibrated in situ (in place) by comparison to a temperature standard. However, in situations where that is not practical, it is necessary to remove the thermocouple and place it in a precision temperature source such as a dry-well. 9150 Thermocouple Furnace See pg 19 9100S Handheld Dry-Well See pg 17 9144 Field MetrologyWell See pg 17 6102 Micro-Bath Thermometer Calibrator See pg 19 48 Temperature Applications","@ID":48},{"#text":"Hand Pump Pressure Module Pressure Input • The key to a good switch test is repeatability. Repeatability is best achieved by applying a slow change in pressure to the switch as it approaches its set or reset pressure. • When performing the test find out where the switch sets and make sure the vernier/fine adjustment of your test pump has enough adjustment to vary the pressure up to the set point. In this way the pressure can be changed slowly capturing an accurate switch set point pressure. Repeat this procedure for the reset point. • With practice you can get the vernier of the pump within range of the set and reset point pressure and get excellent repeatability of your tests (within the limitations of the switch being tested). TECH TIPS To get started testing the switch, connect as shown above. In this example we will test dry contacts and continuity. To measure continuity for the test select resistance measurement. Then toggle to the source screen mode and select pressure to display the pressure generated by the hand pump and measured by the pressure module. Advance the calibrator mode to the split screen test mode. The next step is to describe the switch and whether it is normally open or closed at ambient pressure. The relaxed state of the switch is the reset state. The set state is the condition of the switch it changes to with applied pressure or vacuum. In this example the switch is normally open and is expected to close when the pressure applied exceeds 10 psi. Next the allowable pressure variance of the switch set state and deadband size needs to be defined. In this example the ideal switch set value is 10 psi and is allowed +/- 1 psi of deviation. The allowable reset pressure is described in the deadband tolerance. In this instance the reset state must be more than 1 psi less than the found set pressure but not greater than 3 psi less than the found set pressure. Once the test tolerances are fully defined start the test. Increase the pressure until the calibrator captures the set state pressure value. Then decrease the pressure until the reset pressure is found. Repeat increasing and decreasing the pressure across the switch looking for repeatability in your set and reset pressure measurements. Once satisfied with the result press done to get the pass/fail evaluation of the switch. If the switch fails the test adjustment or replacement of the switch may be required. If the switch is adjusted repeat the test to document the As-Left condition of the switch before putting back into service. The test result is now documented and ready for upload to calibration management software. To perform the test: With a modern documenting calibrator you can test for dry contacts opening and closing on the switch or if you are using the Fluke 753 or 754 you can leave the switch connected to the live voltage and the calibrator will measure the changing AC voltage and interpret it as opening and closing of the switch. One cautionary note: it is always safer to test a de-energized circuit, but this is not always possible. Also, do not measure AC voltages above 300 V ac as that is the maximum rating of the 75X family. 480 V ac 3-phase voltages must be de-energized and disconnected from the switch if testing with the 75X family.

Temperature controllers provide both switching capability based on rising and dropping temperatures, as well as a local indication of the measured temperature. Most temperature controllers have some form of tuning, using damping and PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative values) for smoothing out the measured process temperature, reducing variability. The terminology around switches can be confusing. The set state of the switch is the action the switch takes when an input stimulus above or below a specified value is applied. This stimulus can prompt an action such as closing a switch, which in turn starts or stops a motor, or opens and closes a valve. The reset point is considered the relaxed state of the switch, which is typically referred to as “Normally Open” or “Normally Closed.” This describes the default condition of the switch.

There are many different ways to simulate these sensors for testing purposes. You can use a mV dc source and a mV vs temperature look up table (below on the left), for simulating thermocouples or a resistance decade box and resistance vs temperature look up table (below on the right), for simulating RTDs.

In situ verification at a single point may be the only way to know whether an instrument is performing as expected. A single point verification is most effective over a narrow temperature range and when combined with other trends and information related to the process and equipment. It also requires the process not to be in a dynamic state of change. In a single point process temperature verification, a temperature standard such a reference PRT connected to a readout such as a 1523A is placed in thermal equilibrium with the sensor of the instrument to be verified without removing it from the process. Usually this is accomplished with a test well that is installed in a location adjacent to the sensor to be tested.

It is normally installed with a 5 valve manifold. If so, closing the valves on the pipeline side of the manifold should isolate it. Be sure to follow local policy and safety procedures when performing this isolation step. Set the P1 sensor of the 721 to measure inH20 and the P2 sensor to measure PSI and the temperature sensor to measure degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit as needed. Low pressure differential pressure calibration is performed using atmospheric pressure as a low side reference. Vent the low connection of the flow computer or pressure transmitter and connect the high pressure connection of the flow computer or transmitter to the low pressure port (P1) on the calibrator. Connect the computer (PC) to the flow computer serial or USB port. The PC will instruct the user to apply one or more test pressures to the flow computer or transmitter. For example, 0, 100 and 200 inH20. Squeeze the pump to get close to the test pressure and use the vernier or fine pressure adjust to dial in. Static pressure calibrationwill normally be applied to either the same high pressure port of the flow computer or both the high and low pressure ports. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for details. Connect the high pressure sensor input (P2) to the appropriate port on the flow computer or transmitter and to the high pressure test source. The PC will instruct the pressures for the user to apply from the pressure source. Temperature calibrationof the temperature measurement on the flow computer is done with a single temperature point at the pipeline operating temperature. Insert the RTD probe into the test thermowell and allow time for the measurement to stabilize. The PC will prompt the user to enter the temperature measured by the calibrator. Remove the RTD from the test thermowell and the calibration is complete. Flow Computers with 4 to 20 mA inputs: Many flow computers utilize a low pressure, static and temperature transmitter to convert the measured parameters into 4 to 20 mA signals. In this instance these transmitters may need individual calibration if the test results are not satisfactory (see HART Transmitter Calibration application note or video for more details). Another source for errors in this configuration is the input A/D cards of the flow computer. These can be independently tested using a mA signal source from a loop calibrator. STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 To perform the test: • Always center the vernier of your hand pump before starting any pressure calibration. This will allow you to increase or decrease the pressure when making fine adjustments. • Store the temperature probe in a protective case such as the built in slot of the 721 soft case. Exposing the RTD probe to mechanical stress can reduce the measurement accuracy of the probe. • Be careful to not connect the P1 low pressure side of the calibrator when doing high pressure calibrations or measurement or the sensor will be damaged and possibly rupture creating a dangerous condition. • Inserting the RTD probe prior to the pressure calibrations typically allows sufficient time to reach a stable temperature measurement.

Gas flow computers make three primary measurements to calculate flow: volumetric flow (difference in pressure across the orifice plate), static pressure in a pipeline and gas temperature. A calculation is performed using this data to determine the actual mass and volume of the gas flowing through the pipeline. These calibrations can be made with three separate calibrators, a low pressure, high pressure and a temperature calibrator or use a multifunction calibration tool designed for this specific task. An example of a calibrator purposed for this task is the Fluke 721 or 721Ex. It has two builtin pressure ranges and the ability to measure temperature.

It is critical that the pressure module be zeroed before test and adjustment. For best ßadjustment success: • After pressing Fetch for the pressure measurement, select the trim button quickly before the pressure measurement changes. • Give the measuredmA and pressure time to settle for best measurement results. • Always de-bug the pressure test setup for leaks in the shop before going to the field, including installing the pressure module connection adapter to the hand pump. • If the full scale value of the transmitter is less than 25 % of the full scale of the pressure module, select a lower range pressure module for best results. • If performing higher pressure calibrations with a hydraulic pump, use the correct fluid such as mineral oil or de-ionized water. Standard tap water will leave deposits in the pump and cause erratic operation, leaks or difficulty priming. • If the pass/fail accuracy is set at the limits for the transmitter, adjust the transmitter if the errors are greater than 25 % of limits. • If the errors are less than 25 % of limits, it might be best to not adjust the transmitter as adjusting might make it less accurate. Isolate the transmitter from the process being measured and its loop wiring. If measuring the mA signal across the transmitter test diode leave the wires intact, but note this method does not give the best mA measurement accuracy. Connect the mA measurement jacks of the 754 to the transmitter. Connect the pressure module cable to the 754 and connect the transmitter test hose from the hand pump to the transmitter. Press the HART button on the calibrator to see the configuration of the transmitter. Press HART again and the calibrator will offer the correct measure/source combination for the test. If documenting the calibration press As-Found, input the test tolerance and follow the prompts. If the measured mA signal at the test points is found within tolerance the test is complete.

Common errors include pressing the infrared calibrator too close to the hot surface of the calibrator or simply moving the infrared thermometer back and forth until the desired reading is achieved. The manufacturer will have calibrated the infrared thermometer at a specific distance with a source that meets certain size requirements and has a specific emissivity (often but not always 0.95).

Today most pressure switches are tested with a pressure gauge mounted to a pump to supply and measure pressure, and a DMM set to continuity to verify the opening and closing of the switch. The technician or electrician making the test is required to interpret the pressure applied to the switch when the continuity beeper sounds indicating contact closure of the switch.

The reference pressure gauge (2700G) should be mounted vertically. For hydraulic comparators prime the fluid with the priming pump, to remove any bubbles. Measurement points should be distributed uniformly over the calibration range. Conveniently source pressure with a manual pump up to 300 psi, after that use an external pressure supply. For gas comparators use the fine needle valve or fine adjustment screw press to precisely meter the pressure. With hydraulic models use the screw press to source and fine adjust the pressure. The source pressure can be adjusted until the device under test is reading a nominal pressure or until the reference gauge reads the nominal pressure. • The key to a good experience in using a hand pump, either pneumatic or hydraulic, is to test and debug your test setup in the shop before going to the field. Minimizing the number of pressure connections minimizes the probability for leaks. Mount the test gauge carefully to the test pump in the shop. • Be sure to consider the hoses that connect from the hand pump to the device to be tested. There are a variety of specialty “no tools required” connectors to connect to the test hose to make this easy. If these connectors are not available be sure to have a variety of adapters, wrenches and PFTE sealing tape to be able to connect from the test hose to the input port of the device for testing. If using “push fit” hoses it is likely they will eventually leak. Each time - a push fit hose is connected, it leaves a mark on the test hose and eventually does not seal well. To eliminate the leak cut off the affected portion of the test hose so there is a clean surface to connect to. This process will need to be repeated with use. • When attempting to get maximum pressure out of a pneumatic pump, adjust the fine adjust vernier all the way to down to the stop so turning the vernier increases the pressure. When approaching the target pressure use the vernier to increase to your target pressure. • When using hydraulic hand pumps remember the thermodynamic effect. Once any fluid is compressed, the temperature increases and the fluid expands. This becomes obvious when pumping to a target pressure with a hydraulic pump. Once the target pressure is met the fluid has expanded. As the fluid cools and contracts the pressure quickly bleeds down until it reaches temperature equilibrium, this can take 5 minutes or more. Once the temperature stops changing, dial the desired pressure back in with the vernier adjuster.
