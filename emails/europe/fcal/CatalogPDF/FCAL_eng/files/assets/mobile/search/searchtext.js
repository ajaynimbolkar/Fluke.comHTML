This discipline is usually referred to as RF and microwave metrology. Principal parameters include RF voltage, RF power, impedance, modulation, distortion, time, frequency and phase. High dynamic range ratiometric comparisons are often performed and results are expressed in the logarithmic “dB” form. As with any other calibration, RF and microwave calibration compares a device or unit under test (DUT or UUT) to a traceably calibrated standard or reference device. The process typically involves comparing a measuring UUT to a reference source; a sourcing UUT with a measuring reference; or quite commonly a measuring UUT with a measuring reference, using a stable but unknown source. In each case, the uncertainty or stability of the reference should significantly exceed the specified performance of the device or unit under test. RF metrologists typically look for performance margins of 4:1, however, test uncertainty ratios lower than this usual target are more frequently encountered in RF than in other calibration disciplines. Conversion from logarithmic (dB) to linear units is recommended practice when combining uncertainty contributions and considering test uncertainty ratios. Precision devices that are commonly used in RF and microwave calibration fall broadly into four categories: Sourcing instruments. Reference signals and/ or modulation sources, frequency references, pulse or arbitrary waveform generators, reference attenuators. Measuring instruments. Power sensors, spectrum analyzers, measuring receivers, oscilloscopes, RF voltmeters, frequency counters. Source-measure instruments. Vector or scalar network analyzers. Precision components • Power splitters, power dividers or couplers, attenuating pads • Inter-series, polarity or sacrificial cables and adapters • Short, open, load or sliding terminators • Reflection bridges or directional couplers www.flukecal.com 9 RF Calibration","@ID":11},{"#text":"Data acquisition equipment Get the data you want, where, how and when you want it.

Most importantly, this usually means the temperature sensor, itself, which is typically a platinum resistance thermometer (PRT or PT-100), thermistor, or thermocouple. Readings from these thermometers are made by “thermometer readout” devices which measure their electrical outputs and convert them to temperature according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). Thermometers are typically calibrated by placing them in a stable temperature environment (heat source) and comparing their output to that of a calibrated “reference thermometer” or “standard thermometer.” Fluke Calibration provides three general categories of heat sources: industrial heat sources (dry-well calibrators, Micro-Baths, etc.) for field use; fluid baths and thermocouple furnaces for laboratory use; and fixed-point cells for “primary” calibrations. Fluke Calibration also offers a variety of reference thermometers, including SPRTs, and thermometer readout instruments. In addition, Fluke Calibration provides laboratory and field solutions for calibrating the electronics used in temperature measurement circuits.

This usually involves plumbing the unit under test (UUT) to the standard device and generating a common pressure in the measurement circuit. The outputs of the devices are compared at one or more pressures, typically from the lowest to highest readings of the UUT’s full scale range, or the range over which it is normally used. The comparison process can be performed in a chain from the highest level of fundamental pressure realization down to everyday pressure measurement devices, such as analog gauges, transducers and transmitters, to ensure that pressure measurements are accurate and comply with accepted or mandated standards. The test fluid inside a pressure calibration system may be liquid or gas depending on the application. In general, gas (usually compressed nitrogen or air) is used for cleanliness and precision at lower pressures, and liquids (usually oil or water) are often used for safety, leak integrity, and ease of pressure generation at higher pressures above 7 MPa to 21 MPa (1000 psi to 3000 psi). There is a great deal of overlap in the actual ranges for which liquid or gas may be used practically, as reflected in the range of Fluke Calibration instruments that are specialized for each type of test fluid.

Calibration software also allows users to manage their calibration and asset data. If you’ve heard about the benefits of automated calibration and asset management but are puzzled about how everything fits together, call on Fluke Calibration for solutions. Other types of calibration software from Fluke Calibration include data-logging software, software that generates calibration constants and references, and various add-on and plug-in software programs. Why use calibration software? Using software to automate all or part of the calibration process offers several important advantages. Consistency—Software automation ensures that calibrations can be performed exactly the same way by multiple operators in multiple locations. This improves the quality of results, reduces errors and standardizes methods. Efficiency—Automating the calibration process allows technicians to set up tests and then go on to perform other tasks, making more efficient use of their time. Calibrations are typically completed much more quickly, saving time and money. If the software is capable of calibrating multiple units under test simultaneously, automation increases throughput as well. Documentation and reports—Calibration automation software typically includes features for documenting calibration procedures, storing calibration data, and producing reports, allowing users to eliminate paper records or spreadsheets.

This discipline is usually referred to as dc and low frequency ac electrical metrology. Principal parameters include voltage, current, resistance, inductance, capacitance, time and frequency. Other parameters, including electrical power and phase, are also in this segment of metrology. Ratiometric comparisons of similar parameters are often performed to compare a known parameter to an unknown similar parameter. Electrical calibration involves the use of precise devices that evaluate the performance of key properties for other devices called units under test (UUTs). Because these precise devices have thoroughly known performance characteristics compared to the UUT, performance evaluation and/or calibration adjustment of the UUT to identify or minimize errors is possible. Typically, the performance of such precision devices should be four or more times better than the UUT. These precision devices fall into two broad categories. Electrical signal sources are often referred to as either calibrators or standards. Precision measurement devices are often classified as reference digital multimeters, measurement standards, or ratio bridges. Electrical calibration 2 Electrical Calibration","@ID":4},{"#text":"Gas flow calibration What is gas flow calibration? Gas flow calibration refers to the calibration of a flow sensing device such as a flow meter or flow controller by comparing its measurement against a flow measurement reference. Typically, the device, or unit under test (UUT), is pneumatically connected in series with the flow reference so they measure the same gas flow; then the indications of the two devices are compared. molbloc ™/molbox ™ system components Fluke Calibration’s molbloc/molbox gas flow calibration system consists of molbloc flow elements that connect to a flow terminal (either molbox1+ or molbox RFM) so the terminal can use pressure and temperature measurements from around the flow element, combined with gas properties and prior molbloc calibration data, to determine and display the gas flow rate. Mass flow vs. volume flow A frequent topic of discussion and confusion surrounding gas flow measurement is that of mass flow versus volume flow. Flow meters and flow units used for flow measurements are used to measure and express either the amount of volume of gas or the amount of mass (number of moles or molecules) passing through the device. When performing a gas flow calibration, it is nearly always beneficial to use a mass flow reference measurement, because the mass flow rate stays constant throughout a flow system in steady state. Since gas is compressible, the volume flow rate varies at different locations in a flow system due to changes in density caused by changing temperature and pressure. Fluke Calibration molblocs are mass flow standards, which allow reliable comparisons to other flow devices. The molbox terminal is also able to calculate and express the flow rate in terms of volume flow at another point in the system to allow testing of volume-based devices. www.flukecal.com 37 Gas Flow Calibration","@ID":39},{"#text":"2638A 2686A NetDAQ (2640) 2638A Hydra Series III Data Acquisition System/DMM A price performance breakthrough in standalone data acquisition system. • DC accuracy of 0.0024 % • Best-in-class thermocouple accuracy of 0.5 °C • Up to 67 universal differential, isolated inputs • On screen color trend graphing • Easy menu system for setup and data management • 6.5 digit DMM function selections • Monitor function for real-time viewing and charting between scans • 20 on-board separate math channels • 45 channels/sec basic dc scan rate • Internal 75,000 scan memory plus USB drive port • Expands to thousands of channels with application software • Data security features • USB flash drive support for data transfer to PC • CAT II 300 V input safety rated 2680 Series Data Acquisition Systems Standalone or networked precision multi-channel data acquisition • 20 to 120 universal analog inputs per chassis; systems to +2,000 channels • Stand-alone data logger operation with the 2686A • Large scalable LAN systems using the 2680A with 10BaseT/100BaseT • Two types of Universal Input Modules: high-isolation precision modules or fast scan modules, with 16- to 18-bit resolution • Throughput of more than 3,000 channels-per-secondper-chassis with 2680A-FAI modules • Superior thermocouple measurement accuracy (J, K, R, S, T, N, I, U, C, B) • 20 digital I/O and 8 form C, 1 Amp relay output modules for direct control of equipment • Up to 300 V input isolation, 1600 V transient overvoltage protection (2680A-PAI) • Universal input conditioning for any input, on any channel, in any combination (V dc, V ac, Ohms, frequency, RTD, thermocouple, thermistor or current • ATA flash memory card for stand-alone operation - from 16 MB to 1 GB (2686A only) • Multiple power sources: 100 V to 240 V and 9 V to 45 V dc • Includes Fluke DAQ Software: Controls all 2680 Series functions, provides real-time and historical and also communicates with NetDAQ and Hydra Series III products NetDAQ® Networked Data Acquisition Unit Powerful combination of hardware and software that is ideal for small-to-medium scale process monitoring and test systems. • Data acquisition, up to 1,000 readings per second • 20 analog input channels expandable up to 2,000 channels • Extensive optional plotting and trending capabilities • Includes Fluke DAQ software • Flexible ac or dc power • Replaces chart recorders Fluke DAQ 6.0 Application Software A powerful and versatile application for quick and easy configuration, data logging and analysis using Fluke data acquisition products. • Easy multi-unit configuration for any mix of Fluke 2638A, 1586A, NetDAQ or 2680 Series • Full screen trend charting of up to 32 channels with zoom, print and scaling functions • Built-in OPC server software for sharing Fluke DAQ data with popular client programs • Logon security features • Auto start on power interrupt settings • Master/slave configurations available • Alarm logging with history with acknowledgement features • Four web clients for remote viewing and control of systems using secure login • Automated email of alarm alerts • Up to 2000-channel capability • Runs on a variety of operating systems including Windows 7 and 8 Data acquisition equipment Fluke DAQ 6.0 46 www.flukecal.com Data Acquisition","@ID":48}]}}
